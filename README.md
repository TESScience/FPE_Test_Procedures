# FPE Test Procedures

This is a repository for FPE test procedures for TESS, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.

You can find google documents chronicling the Bring-Up and Functional testing of the TESS Focal Plane Electronics below.

*Note that these links are live and point to the test documents as I am filling them out, so they may be in intermediate (unfinished) states sometimes.*
